# Route-X

RouteX is a platform that verifies the authenticity of products and enables on-chain logistics operations. Users can have confidence in their purchases, knowing that they are buying genuine products and not counterfeits. The platform handles the entire supply chain operation, including adding products and updating product locations, to ensure a secure channel for verifying the origin of the products. Users can easily verify a product by scanning its QR code and accessing all relevant product details.

It is deployed on arweave: [https://provenance.arweave.dev](https://provenance.arweave.dev)
